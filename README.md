## The Course Program meets the following intent: It: 

# 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
# 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
# 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
# 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
# 5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

# Programmer's Notes:

# 1. To aid the peer review only one file was created with complete data sourcing and cleaning.
# 2. All means and standard deviations were extracted. No programmer's judgement was applied to arrive at the inclusion or exclusion of means.
# 3. The descriptive column names were applied before the extraction of required measurements. 
#    The reason is to keep the file future ready when other columns may also be required for separate analysis. 
# 4. The column names were processed for comma, hyphen only. The hyphens were replaced with "_" (underscore) for easy reference to column names.
# 5. The mix of cases (upper and lower) in column names were not disturbed as they do not hinder readability.
